Learning how to git (and about each other)!

Write down two truths and one lie below.

Once you're done, submit a pull request (do NOT commit directly to the main branch)! We'll try to guess the lie before we merge your branch with the main branch.

YOUR NAME HERE: Jacob
1. A truth (or a lie) I have given two bearded dragon eulogies
2. A lie (or a truth) I once ran straight into a dolphin while snorkeling
3. Another truth (or your lie) I played the saxophone so badly that a cooper's hawk attacked me
